## Schedule Outline

:::{warning}
This schedule may be changed during the development of this course.
:::

Below is the outline of weekly activities.
The term "notebook" refers to the Jupyter Notebook script.
The term "tutorial" refers to step-by-step guidences of a notebook script.
We strongly recommand you to bring your laptop during the lectures with tutorials.

:::{admonition} Preparation for Lectures
In the link for each lecture, there is a preparation section.
You **have to** prepare them before going to the lectures or tutorials.
If you come to the class without doing the preparation part, you may not be able to understand the contents of lectures or tutorials.
