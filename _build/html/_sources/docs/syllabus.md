# Course Syllabus

(Last updated: Jan 9, 2023)

:::{admonition} What is data science?
:class: tip
Data science is about turning rich data into **actionable insight** and making data **impactful**!
:::

This course aims to familiarize you with various data science pipelines using examples with different data types.
This course is suitable for students who already have some experience in processing data and will work (or are currently working) with a large amount of data, especially focusing on obtaining insights from data through prediction or explanation techniques.
This course is not intended to cover all topics in data science exhaustively.
Instead, it introduces ways of working with structured (e.g., sensor measurements) and unstructured data (e.g., text and image).
Also, this course will cover human-centered approaches in data science for social impact.

It is important to keep in mind that this course does not aim to teach you details in programming, machine learning, statistics, or visualization.
Instead, this course will teach you how to integrate various techniques (e.g., data wrangling, statistical analysis, data modeling, data visualization) together to perform a data science task.
Also, notice that this course assumes someone already collected datasets for you and does not teach you how to collect data in the real world.
Data collection is a topic that could take a very long time to explain and is out of the scope of this course.

:::{note}
Notice that the course instructor writes the syllabus from the first-person perspective.

## Learning Goals

By the end of the course, we expect you to be able to:
- Know every component in the entire data science pipeline (including data pre-processing, wrangling, analysis, modeling, evaluation, and visualization)
- Perform data science tasks with images (e.g., object recognition), text (e.g., topic modeling), and structured data (e.g., those from sensor networks) using the Python programming language
- Understand issues around data science tasks, including searching for datasets, annotating data, ensuring reproducibility, managing programming code efficiently, and paying attention to research ethics

## Prerequisites

This course expects you to have the following prior knowledge:
- Advanced level of Python programming (e.g., knowing different data types and data structures, knowing how to set up the Jupyter Notebook programming environment)
- Intermediate level of machine learning (e.g., knowing what supervised and unsupervised learning means, recognizing that a "random forest" is not just a forest in some random places, understanding the differences between classification and regression)
- Intermediate level of information visualization (e.g., knowing how to draw various plots using python packages, understanding the differences between a bar chart and histogram)
- Basic level of research methods (e.g., knowing what "research questions" mean, understanding basic hypothesis testing methods like t-test)

## Course Structure

This course has 8 weeks in total.
Among them, weeks 4 and 8 will be used for mid-term and final exams.
Except weeks 4 and 8, each week has two lectures (hoorcollege) and a work session (werkcollege).
Week 4 has only one lecture for discussing the mid-term exam (no work sessions).
Week 8 only has the final exam (no lectures nor work sessions).
Refer to the [overview page](home#schedule-outline) for the course schedule.

Lectures will be given in English, as well as all the teaching materials.
Work sessions will given in either Dutch or English, depending on the TA's choice.

Course materials contain slide decks, Jupyter notebooks, and three modules.
Each module contains preparation, turorials, and assignments for learning how to perform different data science tasks.
Modules are designed to have you work to have hands-on experiences.

## Virtual/Physical Settings

In principle, I will give the lecture in person in the physical classroom.
I will open a virtual classroom link to live stream the lectures (refer to Canvas for the links).
If I cannot give the physical lecture due to expected situations, I will make an announcement on Canvas to give the lecture in the virtual classroom.

It is important to notice that when I give the lecture in the physical classroom, the virtual classroom will be muted and not be actively monitored.
It is very challenging for me to pay attention to both the physical and virtual audiences, and priority will be given to people who attend the physical classroom.

I will also do my best to record the lectures (with the camera pointing to my face only) and make the recordings available on Canvas.
However, there is no professional support for recording in my course, so there is no guarantee of the recording quality.
For example, you may experience poor sound quality or incomplete lectures in the recorded video.

In principle, the work sessions (werkcollege) are in-person only.
If the TAs cannot attend the physical classroom due to unexpected situations, they may give the sessions virtually.

## Grading: Exams and Assignments

Your final grade is based only on exams (the mid-term exam is 50% weight, and the final exam is also 50% weight).
There is a resit for the course (100% weight).

The mid-term and final exams are all based on coding questions, which are designed to test your knowledge in different parts of the data science pipeline.
We will provide Jupyter notebooks during the exams with instructions.
Then, the notebooks that you handed in will be auto-graded with test cases using the [nbgrader package](https://nbgrader.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html).
We will provide mock-up exam notebooks and test cases for you to practice.

:::{warning}
We are still working with the ICT team to figure out if it is possible to allow students to have access to some API websites (e.g., pandas, numpy, scipy) during the exams.
But for now, you should assume that you will have no internet access during the exams.
:::

During the mid-term and final exams, you may bring an A4-size cheat sheet with you.
You can choose to handwrite or print the content on both sides of the cheat sheet.
Please keep in mind that you are not allowed to bring other materials, such as books.
You are also not allowed to bring or use any other digital devices (besides the computer for the exam).

Assignments are not graded, but you should do them as they are essential in improving your data science skills.
We expect you to do the assignments by yourself and discuss them with the TAs in working sessions.
The questions in mid-term and final exams will have similar questions as those in the assignments.
Doing the assignments will also help you greatly in preparing for the exams.

## Hygiene

Please follow [the advice from RIVM](https://www.rivm.nl/en/coronavirus-covid-19/recommendations-companies-and-institutions) (National Institute for Public Health and the Environment) regarding coronavirus measures.
