# Assignment 1: Python Coding Warm-Up

## Materials

- [Python Coding Warm-Up Notebook](../others/warm-up)
- [Answers for the Python Coding Warm-Up Notebook](../others/warm_up_answer)

## Usage

Do the following steps to set up the assignment:
- Have the [JupyterLab](https://jupyter.org/install) environment ready.
- Download both the original notebook and the answer. You can download the files by clicking on the download icon at the top of the webpage when visiting the notebook pages.
- **Put the two files together in the same directory.** This step is important since the answer notebook is used to check your code using test cases. 
- Open the original notebook file and start doing the assignment.

## Additional Recourses

Check the [Pandas API](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/index.html) when writing the code.
