## Preparation

Go through [this NumPy Tutorial](https://numpy.org/devdocs/user/quickstart.html) to make sure that you understand the basics of operating matrices.

## Materials

Follow the steps below to self-study PyTorch:
- Step 1: Spend 10 minutes to skim through [this PyTorch tutorial notebook](https://uvadlc-notebooks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial_notebooks/tutorial2/Introduction_to_PyTorch.html)
- Step 2: Set up the notebook in Google Colab by clicking on the "Open in Colab" icon at the begining of the notebook
- Step 3: Watch the following two videos while working on the notebook mentioned in the previous step at the same time
  - [Introduction to PyTorch (Part 1)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wnKZZgFQY-E)
  - [Introduction to PyTorch (Part 2)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=schbjeU5X2g)
- Step 4: Go through the notebook again to make sure that you understand the basics of PyTorch
