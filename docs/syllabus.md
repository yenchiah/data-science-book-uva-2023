# Course Syllabus

(Last updated: Feb 10, 2023)

:::{admonition} What is data science?
:class: tip
Data science is about turning rich data into **actionable insight** and making data **impactful**!
:::

This course aims to familiarize you with various data science pipelines using examples with different data types.
This course is suitable for students who already have some experience in processing data and will work (or are currently working) with a large amount of data, especially focusing on obtaining insights from data through prediction or explanation techniques.
This course is not intended to cover all topics in data science exhaustively.
Instead, it introduces ways of working with structured (e.g., sensor measurements) and unstructured data (e.g., text and image).
Also, this course will cover human-centered approaches in data science for social impact.

It is important to keep in mind that this course does not aim to teach you details in programming, machine learning, statistics, or visualization.
Instead, this course will teach you how to integrate various techniques (e.g., data wrangling, statistical analysis, data modeling, data visualization) together to perform a data science task.
Also, notice that this course assumes someone already collected datasets for you and does not teach you how to collect data in the real world.
Data collection is a topic that could take a very long time to explain and is mostly out of the scope of this course.

:::{note}
Notice that the course instructor writes the syllabus from the first-person perspective.
:::

## Learning Goals

By the end of the course, we expect you to be able to:
- Know every component in the entire data science pipeline (including data pre-processing, wrangling, analysis, modeling, evaluation, and visualization).
- Perform data science tasks with images (e.g., object recognition), text (e.g., topic modeling), and structured data (e.g., those from sensor networks) using the Python programming language.
- Critically reflect on the model performance using various metrics and obtain meaningful insights from data analysis.
- Understand issues around data science tasks, such as algorithm bias, research ethics, reproducibility, and data annotation.

## Prerequisites

This course expects you to have the following prior knowledge:
- Intermediate level of Python programming (e.g., knowing different data types and data structures, knowing how to set up the Jupyter Notebook programming environment)
- Basic level of machine learning (e.g., knowing what supervised and unsupervised learning means, understanding the differences between classification and regression)
- Basic level of information visualization (e.g., knowing how to draw plots using python packages, understanding the differences between a bar chart and histogram)
- Basic level of research methods (e.g., knowing what "research questions" mean, understanding basic hypothesis testing methods like t-test)

## Course Structure

This course has 8 weeks in total.
Among them, weeks 4 and 8 will be used for mid-term and final exams.
Except weeks 4 and 8, each week has two lectures (hoorcollege) and a work session (werkcollege).
Week 4 has only one lecture for discussing the mid-term exam (no work sessions).
Week 8 only has the final exam (no lectures nor work sessions).
Refer to the [overview page](home#schedule-outline) for the course schedule.

Lectures will be given in English, as well as all the teaching materials.
Work sessions will given in either Dutch or English, depending on the TA's choice.

Course materials contain slide decks, Jupyter notebooks, and three modules.
Each module contains preparation, turorials, and assignments for learning how to perform different data science tasks.
Modules are designed to have you work to have hands-on experiences.

## Virtual/Physical Settings

In principle, I will give the lecture in person in the physical classroom.
I will open a virtual classroom link to live stream the lectures (refer to Canvas for the links).
If I cannot give the physical lecture due to unexpected situations, I will make an announcement on Canvas to give the lecture in the virtual classroom.

It is important to notice that when I give the lecture in the physical classroom, the virtual classroom will be muted and not be actively monitored.
It is very challenging for me to pay attention to both the physical and virtual audiences, and priority will be given to people who attend the physical classroom.

I will also do my best to record the lectures (with the camera pointing to my face only) and make the recordings available on Canvas.
However, there is no professional support for recording in my course, so there is no guarantee of the recording quality.
For example, you may experience poor sound quality or incomplete lectures in the recorded video.

In principle, the work sessions (werkcollege) are in-person only.
If the TAs cannot attend the physical classroom due to unexpected situations, they may give the sessions virtually.

## Grading: Exams and Assignments

Your final grade is based only on exams (the mid-term exam is 40% weight, and the final exam is 60% weight).
There is one resit for the course, which counts as 100% weight.
According to the [UvA rule](https://www.uva.nl/en/about-the-uva/policy-and-regulations/rules-and-regulations/teaching/teaching.html#Model-regulations), the most recent grade will apply in the event of a resit regardless of the outcome.
This means that if you take the resit, your resit score will override the weighted sum of your mid-term and final exam grades.

According to the [OER rule](https://student.uva.nl/onderwerpen/onderwijs-en-examenregelingen-oer), you need to get at least 5.5 in the final score (i.e., the weighted sum of the scores of two exams) to pass the course.
After each exam, the teaching team will grade the exam and release the grades within 20 working days.
After the grade is released, we will announce on Canvas how students can inspect their exam results.

### Exams

Exam instructions and materials will all be in English.

The mid-term and final exams are based on coding questions (and may also contain multiple-choice questions), which are designed to test your knowledge in different parts of the data science pipeline.
We will provide Jupyter notebooks during the exams with instructions.
Then, the notebooks that you handed in will be auto-graded with hidden test cases using the [nbgrader package](https://nbgrader.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html).
We will provide mock-up exam notebooks and visible test cases for you to practice.

:::{warning}
Coding questions in the exams may have restrictions on functions (i.e., the ones that you are not allowed to use).
Please pay attention to the question instructions.
``Using the restricted functions will result in a 0 score for the corresponding question.``
:::

:::{warning}
Your score for each coding question is based on the number of passed hidden test cases (excluding the one that we will provide).
``We do not give scores to failed test cases or syntax errors.``
Before submitting the coding exam, you need to check if there are errors and fix them by running the entire provided Jupyter notebook from scratch (i.e., click on the “Restart All Kernels and Run All Cells” in the “Kernel” menu on the JupyterLab interface).
We will provide test cases in the exam Jupyter notebook for you to self-check.
:::

During the mid-term and final exams, you may bring an A4-size cheat sheet with you.
You can choose to handwrite or print the content on both sides of the cheat sheet.
Please keep in mind that you are not allowed to bring other materials, such as books.
You are also not allowed to bring or use any other digital devices (besides the computer for the exam).

:::{warning}
You must hand in the cheat sheet immediately after the exam.
``It is not allowed to take the cheat sheet back with you.``
:::

:::{note}
You will have no internet access during the exams.
However, you can use the question mark "?" syntax to [access the IPython help](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/interactive/python-ipython-diff.html#accessing-help) to check the documentation of functions.
:::

### Assignments

Assignment instructions and materials will all be in English.

Assignments are not graded, but you should do them as they are essential in improving your data science skills.
You also do not need to submit the assignments.
We expect you to do the assignments by yourself and discuss them with the TAs in the work sessions.
The questions in mid-term and final exams can have similar questions as those in the assignments.
Doing the assignments will also help you greatly in preparing for the exams.

## Hygiene
