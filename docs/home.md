## Schedule Outline

:::{warning}
This schedule may be changed during the development of this course.
:::

Below is the outline of weekly activities.
The term "notebook" refers to the Jupyter Notebook script.
The term "tutorial" refers to step-by-step guidences of a notebook script.
We strongly recommand you to bring your laptop during the lectures with tutorials.

:::{admonition} Preparation for Lectures
In the link for each lecture, there is a preparation section.
You **have to** prepare them before going to the lectures or tutorials.
If you come to the class without doing the preparation part, you may not be able to understand the contents of lectures or tutorials.
:::

- Week 1
  - [Lecture 1](lectures/lec-1): Introduce the course and explain why data science is important using examples
  - [Assignment 1](others/warm-up) (work session and self-study): Python programming warm-up (e.g., pandas, numpy, scipy)
  - Lecture 2: Recap fundamentals of data science techniques (e.g., basic statistics, basic machine learning concepts, metrics to evaluate model performance)
- Week 2
  - Lecture 3: `Tutorial` for the structured data processing module (using Jupyter Notebook)
  - Assignment 2 (work session and self-study): Structured data processing module
  - Lecture 4: Explain details and more examples in the pipeline of processing structured data (e.g., sensor measurements, citizen reported smell ratings)
- Week 3
  - Lecture 5: Provide practical tips for data science (e.g., websites for searching public datasets, ways of scraping data online, techniques of annotating data,     code management using Git and GitHub, best practices of writing good code, techniques of documenting projects such as GitHub Pages and Jupyter Book)
  - Assignment 3 (work session and self-study): Practice mock-up exam
  - Lecture 6: TBA (continue lecture 5 or have a guest lecture)
- Week 4
  - Mid-term Exam
  - A lecture to discuss the mid-term exam

  - Lecture 10: Explain details and more examples in the pipeline of processing image data (e.g., object recognition and detection)
- Week 7
  - Lecture 11: Introduce the human-centered approach in data science (e.g., human-centered metrics to evaluate models, human-in-the-loop machine learning, citizen participation in data analysis, research ethics, privacy issues, data biases, social impact of data science, algorithmic fairness, explainability, reproducibility, open science)
  - Assignment 6 (work session and self-study): Practice mock-up exam
