## Description

:::{admonition} What is data science?
:class: tip
Data science is about turning rich data into **actionable insight** and making data **impactful**!
:::

This course aims to familiarize you with various data science pipelines using examples with different data types.
This course is suitable for students who already have some experience in processing data and will work (or are currently working) with a large amount of data, especially focusing on obtaining insights from data through prediction or explanation techniques.
This course is not intended to cover all topics in data science exhaustively.
Instead, it introduces ways of working with structured (e.g., sensor measurements) and unstructured data (e.g., text and image).
Also, this course will cover human-centered approaches in data science for social impact.

It is important to keep in mind that this course does not aim to teach you details in programming, machine learning, statistics, or visualization.
Instead, this course will teach you how to integrate various techniques (e.g., data wrangling, statistical analysis, data modeling, data visualization) together to perform a data science task.
Also, notice that this course assumes someone already collected datasets for you and does not teach you how to collect data in the real world.
Data collection is a topic that could take a very long time to explain and is out of the scope of this course.

## Learning Goals

By the end of the course, we expect you to be able to:
- Know every component in the entire data science pipeline (including data pre-processing, wrangling, analysis, modeling, evaluation, and visualization)
- Perform data science tasks with images (e.g., object recognition), text (e.g., topic modeling), and structured data (e.g., those from sensor networks) using the Python programming language
- Understand issues around data science tasks, including searching for datasets, annotating data, ensuring reproducibility, managing programming code efficiently, and paying attention to research ethics

## Prerequisites

This course expects you to have the following prior knowledge:
- Advanced level of Python programming (e.g., knowing different data types and data structures, knowing how to set up the Jupyter Notebook programming environment)
- Intermediate level of machine learning (e.g., knowing what supervised and unsupervised learning means, recognizing that a "random forest" is not just a forest in some random places, understanding the differences between classification and regression)
- Intermediate level of information visualization (e.g., knowing how to draw various plots using python packages, understanding the differences between a bar chart and histogram)
- Basic level of research methods (e.g., knowing what "research questions" mean, understanding basic hypothesis testing methods like t-test)

## Course Structure and Grading

This course contains lectures (i.e., hoorcollege), modules, and two exams.
Lectures are designed to help you understand the pipelines.
Modules are designed to have you work to have hands-on experiences in the work sessions (i.e., werkcollege).
Lectures will be given in English.
Work sessions will given in either Dutch or English, depending on the TA's choice.

The mid-term and final exams are designed to test your knowledge in different parts of the data science pipeline.
The course's evaluation is based on exams (the mid-term exam is 50%, and the final exam is also 50%).
There is a resit for the final exam.

## Schedule Outline

:::{warning}
This schedule is just temporary and may be changed during the development of this course.
:::

This course has 8 weeks in total.
Among them, weeks 4 and 8 will be used for mid-term and final exams.
Except weeks 4 and 8, each week has two lectures (hoorcollege) and a work session (werkcollege).
Week 4 has only one lecture for discussing the mid-term exam (no practical sessions).
Week 8 only has the final exam (no lectures nor practical sessions).
Below is the outline of weekly activities:

- Week 1
  - Lecture 1: Introduce the course and explain why data science is important using examples
  - Lecture 2: Recap general data science pipelines and techniques (e.g., basic statistics, basic machine learning concepts)
  - Practical Session: Structured Data Processing Module
- Week 2
  - Lecture 3 & 4: Explain the pipeline of processing structured data (e.g., sensor measurements, citizen reported smell ratings)
  - Practical Session: Structured Data Processing Module
- Week 3
  - Lecture 5 & 6: Explain the pipeline of processing text data (e.g., topic modeling)
  - Practical Session: Text Data Processing Module
- Week 4
  - Mid-term Exam
  - A lecture to discuss the mid-term exam
- Week 5
  - Lecture 7 & 8: Explain the pipeline of processing image data (e.g., object recognition and detection)
  - Practical Session: Text Data Processing Module
- Week 6
  - Lecture 9 & 10: Introduce the human-centered approach in data science (e.g., research ethics, privacy issues, data biases, social impact of data science, algorithmic fairness, explainability, reproducibility, open science)
  - Practical Session: Image Data Processing Module
- Week 7
  - Lecture 11 & 12: Provide practical tips for data science (e.g., websites for searching public datasets, ways of scraping data online, techniques of annotating data, code management using Git and GitHub, best practices of writing good code, techniques of documenting projects such as GitHub Pages and Jupyter Book)
  - Practical Session: Image Data Processing Module
- Week 8
  - Final Exam
